# Automotive Inventory System - Overview

## What is this project?

The Automotive Inventory System is a user-friendly desktop application designed for car dealerships. It helps dealership staff manage their day-to-day operations more efficiently through an easy-to-use digital system.

## What does it do?

This system replaces paper records and spreadsheets with a streamlined digital solution that:

- Keeps track of all cars in the dealership (both in stock and sold)
- Manages information about customers who purchase vehicles
- Maintains records of employees who work at the dealership
- Records all sales transactions when a car is sold
- Calculates commissions for salespeople
- Generates reports about inventory and sales performance

## How does it work?

The system works through a simple, intuitive interface with different sections:

- **Car Inventory**: View all cars, add new vehicles, update details, or mark cars as sold
- **Customer Management**: Store and access customer information for better service
- **Employee Records**: Keep track of staff details including commission rates
- **Sales Tracking**: Record new sales and view sales history
- **Reports**: Generate summaries of inventory status and sales performance

All information is stored in a database that automatically updates as you use the system. The interface is designed with a modern dark theme to reduce eye strain during long hours of use.

## What can you do with it?

With this system, dealership staff can:

- **Find information quickly**: Look up car details, customer history, or employee information in seconds
- **Process sales efficiently**: Record new sales with just a few clicks
- **Make informed decisions**: Use reports to understand which cars sell best and which employees perform well
- **Improve customer service**: Access customer history instantly when they return to the dealership
- **Reduce paperwork**: Eliminate the need for paper records and manual calculations
- **Save time**: Automate repetitive tasks like commission calculations and inventory updates

The system is perfect for small to medium-sized car dealerships looking to modernize their operations without investing in complex, expensive software.
